# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is both a mathematical optimization method and a computer programming method. In both contexts it refers to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problem in a recursive manner. While some decision problems cannot be taken apart this way, decisions that span several points in time do often break apart recursively. Likewise, in computer science, if a problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal solutions to the sub-problem, then it is said to have `optimal substructure`.

If sub-problems can be nested recursively inside larger problems, so that dynamic programming methods are applicable, then there is a relation between the value of the larger problem and the values of the sub-problems.

In general, a problem can be solved with dynamic programming if it has:

- `optimal substructure`, which means the problem can be solved with one or finite sub-problems;
- `repeated sub-problems`, which means that the sub-problems will be solved multiple times.

The `optimal substructure` defines the relationship between origin problem and its sub-problems, and `repeated sub-problems` defines the relationship between sub-problems. If `optimal substructure` is not satisfied, we can not apply the `dp` method; if `repeated sub-problems` is not satisfied, we can apply `dp`, but it has no advange over `recursive` method.

The general process of applying `dp` is:

1. Define the state variable, this is the most flexible step, different state variables has different transmission functions.
2. Define the transmission function, in this step we iterate all possible `selections` and get the state with one or more sub-states.
3. Define the base case, this is necessary when we need more than one sub-problem solutions at the begining but they are not solved.
4. Solve the problem by calculating the state value needed.

## Linear Dp

The main characteristic of `linear dp` is that the problem is related to its position. 

### Single Sequence

#### Longest Increasing Subsequence(LIS)

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

The typical solution for `LIS` is `dp`, we define:

1. `state` dp[i]: the length of LIS which ends with `nums[i]`;
2. `transform`: dp[i] = max(dp[j]) + 1, where $0 \le j < i$ and $nums[j] < nums[i]$;
3. `base case`: dp[0] = 1

And we have the function:

```C++
int Lis(vector<int>& a) {
  int m = a.size();
  vector dp(m, 1);

  for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
      if (a[j] >= a[i]) continue;
      dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
    }
  }

  return *max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());
}
```

Complexity:

- Time complexity: $O(N^2)$
- Space complexity: $O(N)$

The general greedy strategy is that we let the subsequence increasing as slowly as posible. So we define an array `d` to store the minimum last number of the subsequence of each lenth, `d[len]` stores the minimum last number of the subsequence of the length i. If current number is greater than `d[len]`, we increase the `len` and update `d[len + 1]` to current number; otherwise we use binary search to update `d[j]` with current number, where `dp[j] >= current number`.

```C++
int Lis(vector<int>& a) {
  auto bs = [](auto& d, int tar, int l, int r) {
    while (l < r) {
      int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
      if (d[mid] < tar) {
        l = mid + 1;
      } else {
        r = mid;
      }
    }

    return l;
  };
  int m = a.size();
  vector d(m + 1, a[0]);
  int len = 1;

  for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
    if (a[i] > d[len]) {
      d[++len] = a[i];
    } else {
      int j = bs(d, a[i], 1, len);
      d[j] = a[i];
    }
  }

  return len;
}
```

Complexity:

- Time complexity: $O(NlogN)$
- Space complexity: $O(N)$

#### Stock Series Problems

The general description for stock problems is:

> you're given an integer array of stock prices: `prices`, and you can complete at most `k` transactions.

We define the state as: `dp[i][j][x]` means that `[0:i]` prices with `j` transactions and current state is `x`(0 or 1, 0 for empty, 1 for hold). And we define that a transaction including buying and selling.

The code can be:

```C++
dp[0][0][1] = -ps[0];
for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) { dp[i][0][1] = max(dp[i - 1][0][1], -ps[i]); }
for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
  for (int j = 1; j <= k; ++j) {
    dp[i][j][0] = max(dp[i - 1][j][0], dp[i - 1][j - 1][1] + ps[i]);
    dp[i][j][1] = max(dp[i - 1][j][1], dp[i - 1][j][0] - ps[i]);
  }
}

## Prefix Sum

Prefix sums are trivial to compute in sequential models of computation, by using the formula $y_{i} = y_{i - 1} + x_{i}$ to compute each output value in sequence order. However, despite their ease of computation, prefix sums are a useful primitive in certain algorithms such as counting sort, and they form the basis of the scan higher-order function in functional programming languages. Prefix sums have also been much studied in parallel algorithms, both as a test problem to be solved and as a useful primitive to be used as a subroutine in other parallel algorithms.

Abstractly, a prefix sum requires only a binary associative operator $\oplus$, making it useful for many applications from calculating well-separated pair decompositions of points to string processing.

Mathematically, the operation of taking prefix sums can be generalized from finite to infinite sequences; in that context, a prefix sum is known as a partial sum of a series. Prefix summation or partial summation form linear operators on the vector spaces of finite or infinite sequences; their inverses are finite difference operators.

There are two types of prefix sum, 1d and 2d:

```C++

for (int len = 1; len <= m; ++len) {
  for (int i = 0; i + len - 1 < m; ++i) {
    int j = i + len - 1;

    // dp[i][j] = ...
