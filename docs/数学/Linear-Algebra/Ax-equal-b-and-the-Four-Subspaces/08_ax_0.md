# Soving Ax = 0: pivot variables, special solutions

We have definition for the column space and the nullspace of a matrix, but how do we compute these subspaces?

## Computing the nullspace

The `nullspace` of a matrix $A$ is made up of the vectors $\mathbf{x}$ for which $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$.

$$
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\
2 & 4 & 6 & 8 \\
3 & 6 & 8 & 10
\end{bmatrix}
$$

(Note that the columns of this matrix $A$ are not independent.) Our algorithm for computing the nullspace of this matrix uses the method of elimination, despite the fact that $A$ is not invertible. We don't need to use an augmented matrix because the right side (the vector $\mathbf{b}$) is $\mathbf{0}$ in this computation.

The row operations used in the method of elimination don't change the solution to $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ so they don't change the nullspace. (They do affect the column space.)

The first step of elimination gives us:

$$
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\
2 & 4 & 6 & 8 \\
3 & 6 & 8 & 10
\end{bmatrix}
\to
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & 2 & 4 \\
0 & 0 & 2 & 4
\end{bmatrix}
$$

We don't find a pivot in the second column, so our next pivot is the 2 in the third column of the second row:

$$
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & 2 & 4 \\
0 & 0 & 2 & 4 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\to
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & 2 & 4 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
= U
$$

The matrix $U$ is in `echelon`(staircase) form. The third row is zero because row 3 was a linear combination of rows 1 and 2; it was eliminated.

The `rank` of a matrix A equals the number of pivots it has. In this example, the rank of $A$ (and of $U$) is $2$.

## Special solutions

Once we've found $U$, we can back-substitution to find the solution $\mathbf{x}$ to the equation $U\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$. In our example, columns 1 and 3 are `pivot columns` containing pivots, and columns 2 and 4 are `free columns`. We can assign any value to $x_2$ and $x_4$; we call these `free variables`. Suppose $x_2 = 1$ and $x_4 = 0$. Then:

$$
2 x_3 + 4 x_4 = 0 \to x_3 = 0
$$

and:

$$
x_1 + 2x_2 + 2x_3 + 2x_4 = 0 \to x_1 = -2
$$

So one solution is $\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$ (because the second column is just twice the first column). Any multiple of this vector is in the nullspace.

Letting a different free variable equal 1 and setting the other free variables equal to zero gives us other vectors in the nullspace. For example:

$$
\mathbf{x} =
\begin{bmatrix}
2 \\
0 \\
-2 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

has $x_4 = 1$ and $x_2 = 0$. The nullspace of $A$ is the collection of all linear combinations of these "special solution" vectors.

The rank $r$ of $A$ equals the number of pivot columns, so the number of free columns is $n - r$: the number of columns(variables) minus the number of pivot columns. This equals the number of special solution vectors and the dimension of the nullspace.

## Reduced row echelon form

By continuing to use the method of elimination we can convert $U$ to a matrix $R$ in `reduced row echelon form`(rref), which pivots equal to 1 and zeros above and below the pivots.

$$
U =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & 2 & 4 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\to
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 0 & -2 \\
0 & 0 & 2 & 4 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\to
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 0 & -2 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
= R
$$

By exchanging some columns, $R$ can be rewritten with a copy of the identity matrix in the upper left corner, possibly followed by some free columns on the right. If some rows of $A$ are linearly dependent, the lower rows of the matrix $R$ will be filled with zeros:

$$
R = \begin{bmatrix} I & F \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}
$$

Here $I$ is an $r$ by $r$ square matrix.

If $N$ is the `nullspace matrix` $N = \begin{bmatrix} -F \\ I \end{bmatrix}$ then $RN = 0$. Here $I$ is an $n - r$ by $n - r$ square matrix and $0$ is an $m$ by $n - r$ matrix. The columns of $N$ are the special solutions.
